# SimpleArgoDataVisualization
 Very simple data visualization from Argo robots using Matplotlib Pychart and Numpy.

 ARGO is an international project consisting of small, robotic instruments that float around the ocean. These autonomous units relay data to scientists, and the world.

 In this project, I used Matplotlib Pyplot and Numpy in order to process datapoints such as temperature, pressure, salinity, latitude, and longitude. I then calculated the mean, and standard deviation, of the temperature, pressure, and salinity datasets, while also getting rid of NaN values. This data was plotted against the "levels" data, which is a value recorded by ARGO robots. I also added my own touch, which was adding these all in a nice 4 way subplot figure.
